## üêõ Known Issues & Bugs to Fix

### Critical Issues
- [ ] **Currency Flag Parsing Issue**
  - The `--currency` flag is not working properly
  - Currency value remains "U$S" even when different currency is specified
  - Affects both `--rates` and calculation outputs
  - Root cause: Flag parsing or variable assignment issue

### Minor Issues
- [ ] **Help Flag Conflict Resolution**
  - Had to disable default help command due to `-h` shorthand conflict
  - Now using `-?` for help, may not be intuitive for all users
  - Consider alternative shorthand for hours flag

- [ ] **Flag Validation**
  - Need better validation for currency format
  - Should validate supported currency codes
  - Add warning for unsupported currencies

## üîß Technical Improvements
